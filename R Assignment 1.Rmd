```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Generating the data:

```{r seed}
set.seed(21825314)
mydata=rnorm(100,30,2)
```

Finding the sample mean:

```{r mean}
mean(mydata)
```

Finding the sample median:

```{r median}
as.numeric(quantile(mydata, probs=0.5))
```

Finding the 10% trimmed mean:

```{r trim}
mean(mydata, trim=0.1)
```

Finding the 35th percentile:

```{r percent}
as.numeric(quantile(mydata, probs=0.35))
```

Plotting the data as a histogram:

```{r histo}
hist(mydata, xlim=c(24,34), xlab="Value", ylab="Frequency", main="Histogram for Generated Data")
```

The histogram appears to be skewed left.
